# Cat Breed Classifier

A class assignment that involved training a model to predict the accuracy of 12 different cat breeds. This project included training a model with about 200 images per class using Python and Tensorflow. The project also allows users to upload pictures of their cats to see how the model predicts their breeds as well as a gallery of demo images that could be tested against the model.
